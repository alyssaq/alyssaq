title: about me!
---

I like all things dark, quirky and Japanese.

I'm a fan of [efficient eating](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10AXfQHEeZAxhEBZFd-C7MTj0s3mD5SWhVG8jsw0c-hU/pub) and minimalist living.

I enjoy applied maths and building applications that analyse, automate and solve problems. 
I dont always need a good reason to build something. 
If its fun and interesting, I'll [morph it](https://github.com/alyssaq/face_morpher). Sometimes these apps can be [pretty useless](http://alyssaq.github.io/egg). Sometimes they [save me money and decision-making time](https://github.com/alyssaq/iherb-scraper-searcher). 

This blog will showcase my learnings in maths and software engineering with ocasional life slices.

My work summary can be found on linkedin.
